# ObjectTracking-CV-Project

This project focuses on enhancing video object tracking by integrating a pre-trained Mask R-CNN with two primary tracking strategies: Bounding Box Overlap and Keypoint Assignment. Our objective is to refine object detection and maintain consistent identification across video frames.
